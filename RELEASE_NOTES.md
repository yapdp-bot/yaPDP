# yaPDP v0.2.0 — Release Notes

- **Release date:** 2026-09-10
- **Baseline:** [releases/v0.1.0](https://github.com/amesk/yaPDP/releases/tag/releases%2Fv0.1.0) (2026-09-04)
- **Full diff:** [releases/v0.1.0...releases/v0.2.0](https://github.com/amesk/yaPDP/compare/releases/v0.1.0...releases/v0.2.0)

**yaPDP — Yet Another PDP-11/70 web emulator** with an authentic front panel,
a Model 33 ASR teletype, DECscope VT52 terminals and a DEC LP11 printer.
This release ships the promo-video pipeline end to end and tightens the
emulator/headless tooling.

## Headline: demo-reel videos are now generated on the server

The promo pipeline that used to live on one developer's machine now runs
from GitHub Actions. **build-promo-videos** checks out a requested branch,
records every guest-OS demo clip with a headless browser, dubs the reel and
per-clip MP4s with a local **Kokoro-82M** neural narration (no cloud voice
dependency), burns timed chapters/banner titles/subtitles and uploads the
finished files as a downloadable artifact. The reel itself is voiced: intro,
each clip's title card and the outro are narrated, and per-clip timed events
(chapters, spoken phrases, bottom subtitles) are sampled while a clip is
recorded and mixed into the audio at the right moment.

Everything below the headline is the long tail of making that pipeline
actually run green on CI instead of dying at some arbitrary middle step.

## What's New since v0.1.0

- **Server-side demo-video builds (GitHub Actions).** The whole demo-reel
  pipeline runs on demand: record → dub (Kokoro) → assemble → upload, with
  Xvfb-backed headed capture for reliable in-tab audio and distro ffmpeg
  (the static `ffmpeg-static` build lacks the `drawtext` filter the caption
  cards need). The workflow verifies every per-clip export before uploading.
- **Kokoro-82M neural narration engine.** The voice-over recorder
  (`tools/voicer.js`) synthesises narration locally with Kokoro-82M
  (Transformers.js + onnxruntime-node on CPU, voice **US Michael** by
  default) — fully headless, no cloud dependency. The model (~86 MB) is
  downloaded once into the gitignored `.cache/kokoro/` and reused.
- **Demo-reel voice-over narration.** Intro, per-clip title cards and outro
  are spoken; a card whose narration is longer than its visual is stretched
  (freezing the last fully-visible frame), background music is ducked while
  speech plays, and WAVs are cached under `video/voice/` (invalidated
  whenever the script or engine changes).
- **Timed reel events.** The clip recorder stamps chapters / banner titles /
  spoken phrases / bottom subtitles on the media timeline as it drives the
  machine; the assembler turns them into narration, burned overlays and
  `.chapters.txt` / `.srt` sidecars (same path the web UI uses).
- **`bootHeadless` wait-for-silence readiness (`stableMs`).** Headless boots
  now treat the machine as ready once the console has stayed quiet for
  `stableMs`, so an unknown guest image can be explored and its readiness
  prompt derived from the captured output.

## Fixes

- **CI demo-video build runs end to end.** Root-safe Chromium launch, async
  Puppeteer executable-path export (Puppeteer v25 made it a `Promise`), and
  distro ffmpeg with the `drawtext` filter the static build lacks — the reel
  and per-clip MP4s assemble, captions render real apostrophes, and the
  runner's Verify step stops misreporting the (present) audio stream as
  missing.
- **Emulator hangs, image loads and headless-tool correctness.** VT11 gets a
  real `requestInterrupt()` in the refactored machine layer (Lunar Lander no
  longer hangs after the first screen in `?core=1`); the image loader accepts
  a raw `lander.ptap` when no compressed `.zst` exists; the Minimal desktop
  build ships the bootcode tape it needs; the Manual page's "Launch the
  Emulator" button actually launches. `headless-term` keeps guest output on
  timeout, resolves `:export` paths from the working directory and reports
  `:status` truthfully after a `:rewind`.
- **Manual screenshots stay in sync.** Every regenerated illustration is
  written to both the repo source and the React landing mirror, and shows the
  machine's real quiet `@` bootstrap prompt.

# yaPDP v0.1.0 — Release Notes

- **Release date:** 2026-09-04
- **Baseline:** [v0.1.0-alpha2](https://github.com/amesk/yaPDP/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha2) (2026-08-24)
- **Full diff:** [v0.1.0-alpha2...releases/v0.1.0](https://github.com/amesk/yaPDP/compare/v0.1.0-alpha2...releases/v0.1.0)

**yaPDP — Yet Another PDP-11/70 web emulator** with an authentic front panel,
a Model 33 ASR teletype, DECscope VT52 terminals and a DEC LP11 line printer
— and, as of this release, a machine layer that finally looks like the
hardware it emulates.

## Headline: the machine layer becomes cards on a bus

The biggest change of 0.1.0 is invisible on screen and changes everything
under it. The emulator's machine was welded to the browser UI in one
monolithic file; it is now a set of device *cards* on a *bus*
(`src/core/` + `src/devices/`) — the same architectural idea DEC shipped
with the real PDP-11 in 1969. The same machine assembles in the browser
(default) and in pure Node, where RT-11 boots to its prompt in ~1.6 s with
no browser at all. Tooling that used to drive a whole Chromium now runs
headless (`tools/headless-term.js`, with a SIMH-style Ctrl+E command mode).

Every guest OS the project supports is the acceptance test: **ten operating
systems** — Unix V5, RT-11 (×2), RSX-11M 3.2/4.6, RSTS V06C/V7.0/E 9.6/10.1,
XXDP, BSD 2.9/2.11 and BASIC-11 — boot through the quick-boot wizard on the
new stack, and the same matrix runs against the legacy stack
(`E2E_LEGACY=1`) as the parity gate. The guests even found real bugs during
the migration: RSTS/E 9.6 crashed the browser on an unguarded debug hook,
BSD 2.11's loader exposed a Unibus-map range bug, BASIC-11 taught us that a
paper tape must be re-mounted after a reset. All fixed, all green.

The legacy monolith stays behind `?core=0` for comparison and rollback;
retiring it is tracked ([#18](https://github.com/amesk/yaPDP/issues/18)).

## What's New since alpha2


- **Stack-parity e2e gate (10 guests × 2 stacks).** `npm run e2e:os` now
  boots ten real guest OSes to their ready prompts on the refactored core
  stack; `E2E_LEGACY=1` repeats the whole matrix on the legacy stack.
- **Automatic NUL lead-in/trailer on the ASR paper tape** — a fresh tape
  starts with the historic 6-row blank lead-in, and disengaging the punch
  adds a matching trailer (only when data was actually punched — a bare
  tape stays bare).
- **Project roadmap & issue tracking**: `docs/ROADMAP.md`, known issues
  linked to GitHub issues (#15 ULTRIX panic, #16 e2e flake, #18 legacy
  retirement).
- **Full machine-state snapshots (L2/L3).** Save/restore now captures the
  whole machine: CPU, RAM, MMU, mounted images, the registers of all nine
  I/O-page devices (including the punch buffer), the punched paper tape,
  the LP11 printed paper and ON LINE state, the VT52 terminals and the VT11
  vector display with its CRT image. Restoring also re-creates the hardware
  device set.
- **Machine-state dialog.** The STATE floating button opens a snapshot
  manager (save/load/rename/delete) with styled dialogs, replacing the old
  snapshot section on the Storage page.
- **Persistent disk write-back cache (DiskStore).** Guest-OS writes survive
  reloads and are overlaid on the base image, with per-image or full reset.
- **Linux desktop builds**: new deb and AppImage bundle targets.
- **Storage page tabs.** Images and Paper Tapes now live in separate tabs;
  the Paper Tapes tab has its own `.ptap` drop zone, and the full-window
  drop target appears only on the Storage page.
- **About block**: version marker in the sidebar and an About section on
  the Info page.
- **Working ASR paper-tape reader**: load a `.ptap` / `.ptap.zst` / `.txt`
  tape into the teletype's TAPE READER and read it into the machine — START
  feeds at console speed, AUTO feeds one byte per DL11 "input drained"
  signal (X-ON/X-OFF pauses and resumes), STOP and FREE show the Remove
  tape button (loading a tape forces STOP), and the tape moves up and
  shortens as it is read. The CCU
  routes every byte like the keyboard: LOCAL prints the tape on paper
  (tape-to-paper copy), LINE sends to the machine and the echo prints;
  with the punch ON the read bytes are punched onto the output tape —
  tape-to-tape duplication.
- **Availability-aware quick boot.** A build manifest
  (`media/manifest.json`, generated from `media/` at build time) now tells
  the magic-wand picker which guest OS images this deployment actually
  ships — the picker lists only those OSes (plus anything you have imported
  by drag & drop), and the Info page's guest-OS table dims rows whose image
  is not in the build. Deployments without a manifest keep the previous
  show-everything behaviour. The **Minimal** desktop build therefore
  advertises exactly what it can boot: the paper tapes, Unix V5 and RT-11.
- **Guest-OS boot tests (`npm run e2e:os`).** Real operating systems —
  Unix V5, RT-11, BSD 2.11 and DEC BASIC-11 — are now booted by an automated
  test through the quick-boot wizard in Chromium, each verified to reach its
  ready state (shell prompt / monitor prompt), so a regression in the
  emulator core or a boot sequence fails CI-style instead of being noticed
  by eye.
- **Smaller UX wins**: Quick boot button in the welcome dialog, Auto-boot
  shortcut in the power-off dialog, floating REBOOT/STATE buttons on the
  VT52 console page.
- **Fixes**: `trap()` halts on runaway recursion instead of crashing,
  config-changing restores no longer trigger the browser's "Reload site?"
  prompt, and the quick boot types `BOOT PR` / `BOOT RK1` in the historical
  upper case for the upper-case-only DEC guests (the *nix family keeps its
  lower-case commands).
- **Branding**: the sidebar version marker reads `yaPDP v0.1.0` — it no
  longer uppercases the name via CSS. (The stylised all-caps `YAPDP` on the
  promo-video intro title card is intentional and unchanged.)
- **Docs**: user manual cross-links, cropped CONFIG screenshots, rewritten
  Storage section with per-tab screenshots.

# yaPDP v0.1.0-alpha2 — Release Notes

- **Release date:** 2026-08-24
- **Baseline:** [v0.1.0-alpha1](https://github.com/amesk/yaPDP/releases/tag/releases/v0.1.0-alpha1) (2026-08-19)
- **Full diff:** [releases/v0.1.0-alpha1...v0.1.0-alpha2](https://github.com/amesk/yaPDP/compare/releases/v0.1.0-alpha1...v0.1.0-alpha2)

**yaPDP — Yet Another PDP-11/70 web emulator** with an authentic front panel,
a Model 33 ASR teletype, DECscope VT52 terminals and a DEC LP11 line printer.
This alpha focuses on making the peripherals look and behave like the real
DEC hardware.

## Repository

The yaPDP project has moved to GitHub:
[`github.com/amesk/yaPDP`](https://github.com/amesk/yaPDP).

## Highlights

- The console teletype is now an **authentic Model 33 ASR**: redrawn cabinet,
  flat-top keycaps, paper tape punch/reader, rotary CCU switch, sticky
  CTRL/SHIFT latch and BREAK support.
- The **DEC LP11 line printer** gets a full DEC-style cabinet with a rising
  paper page, a hood, an indicator panel and a working ON LINE key.
- The **DECscope VT52** gets a faithful cabinet (slanted beige monoblock,
  dark grey-green glass, scanline tuning), the authentic fritzm/vt52 bitmap
  font and the missing escape sequences (IRM insert mode, ESC L/M).
- The **front panel** is now controllable by clicking the OFF/POWER/LOCK
  position labels, and a bootstrap sticky note adds "Help Me!"/"Bootstrap
  now!" assistance with a power-off guard.
- The Model 33 ASR and the front panel **scale proportionally** to fit the
  window, so the machine stays usable on narrow screens.
- New **click sounds** for panel switches, punch buttons and teletype keys.
- Every navigation sidebar button gets a **tooltip**, and the PANEL button
  shows live machine state (power lamp and a pause/play run indicator).

## What's New

### Model 33 ASR console
- Authentic redraw of the console teletype and cabinet.
- Real ASR-33 paper tape with punch controls, four-position TAPE READER
  switch and latching REL.
- Full keyboard with special keys, BREAK support, sticky CTRL/SHIFT latch,
  dual-legend keys and echo punch for dropped control codes.
- Rotary CCU switch (replaces the LOCAL/LINE buttons) and the Teletype
  Corporation logo on the front panel.

### DEC LP11 printer
- DEC-style cabinet with rising paper that grows to the top of the window.
- Hood, indicator panel and a working ON LINE key.
- Sidebar output-activity lamps with historical DONE/ERROR semantics.

### DECscope VT52
- Authentic cabinet with proportional window scaling and scanline tuning.
- Real fritzm/vt52 bitmap display font and the DEC 'digital' wordmark.
- IRM insert mode, ESC L/M and other previously missing escape sequences.
- New VT52 text mode option (with the shared PasteUtil paste helper).

### Front panel & machine
- Machine power/auto-boot configuration options and a power lamp on the
  Panel nav button.
- Bootstrap sticky note with "Help Me!"/"Bootstrap now!" controls and a
  power-off guard.
- Click OFF/POWER/LOCK position labels to control the switch.
- Global reboot and quick-boot buttons; panel controls reset on reboot.
- New "Power on & Bootstrap" and "Apply & Leave" dialog buttons.
- PANEL nav button shows live status indicators: a power lamp and a
  pause/play icon reflecting the machine run state.

### Scale & layout
- The Model 33 ASR rig scales proportionally to fit the window; paper and
  tape max-heights are divided by the scale and subpixel punchtape seams
  are fixed.
- The front panel (with the Help Me! sticker) scales proportionally to fit
  narrow windows.

### UI & configuration
- Global mute button for all sounds.
- Click sounds for panel switches, punch buttons and teletype keys.
- Tooltips for every navigation sidebar button.
- CONFIG: "Look and sound" and new "Development" tabs; Equipment devices
  grouped with their parameters (no layout shift for inapplicable fields).
- Storage: mounted image count indicator next to Unmount.
- Quick Boot now always shows the terminal type and printer state; BSD 2.11
  waits for the boot prompt.
- Info page uses the animated front-panel GIF.

## Improvements & Polish

- Model 33 ASR: cabinet restyle, flat-top keycaps, slimmer printer/keyboard,
  sans-serif grotesk keycap legends, punch-above-reader 2x2 layout and
  finer punch geometry.
- LP11 cabinet scaled to fit the window like the VT52 console.
- Autoloading balloon moved to the top of the window; teletype tear/save
  buttons centered on screen.
- Config page clarifies which settings require Apply and which take effect
  immediately.
- Landing page: Project Page CTA link; DIGITAL logo removed from the sidebar.
- Image load interrupted dialog: the "Got it" button now comes before
  "Open Storage".

## Bug Fixes

- VT52 bell (BEL) now reaches the terminal and always rings/flashes.
- VT52 no longer renders bold/underline attributes in VT52 mode.
- Authentic 4:3 aspect ratio restored on the VT52 tube.
- VT52 cabinet side panel no longer overflows on Windows 10.
- Tear sound only plays when paper/tape is actually torn off.
- POWER LOCK key click restored alongside the position labels.
- POWER LOCK key stays pointing at the selected LOCK position.
- LP11 whirr sound is no longer aborted by a play/pause race in the
  renderer.
- REBOOT description fixed: the default loader boots only when Auto-boot is
  enabled.

## Documentation

- New user manual page linked from the landing page, illustrated with
  emulator screenshots (config tabs, dialogs, Lunar Lander boot).
- Every Config page option documented in the user manual.
- Guest-OS screenshot generator and a landing-page OS carousel, including a
  new XXDP+ diagnostics screenshot.
- Instructions page cleanup (author contact added).
- README toolchain installation section for the desktop build.
