/**
 * xxdp-lib.js — shared driver for the headless XXDP e2e tests.
 *
 * Every XXDP authenticity-gate test (docs/ROADMAP.md) does the same shape of
 * work: boot XXDP+ off the rk3 disk, answer the date prompt until the monitor
 * is up, launch one DEC diagnostic, then drive it until it reports a clean END
 * PASS (or bail on an error / timeout). The only things that differ per
 * diagnostic are the run command, the startup banner to wait for, the phrasing
 * of the pass/error lines, and — occasionally — panel interaction while the
 * diagnostic runs (EKBBF0 needs switch 7 raised and a character typed per ask;
 * KFPAD0 just paces itself).
 *
 * This module keeps that shared skeleton in one place; each e2e script becomes
 * a declaration of its diagnostic plus a tiny per-test interaction callback,
 * instead of a 100-line near-copy of its sibling.
 *
 * Uses:  const xxdp = require("./xxdp-lib.js");
