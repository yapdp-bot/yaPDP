/**
 * e2e XXDP verification — KFPAD0 (FP11-F floating-point) runs to END PASS.
 *
 * Second authenticity-gate test (after EKBBF0, the 11/70 CPU one). KFPAD0
 * exercises the FP11-F floating-point unit (see docs/xxdp-diagnostics.md:
 * the FP mnemonic = FP11/FPU). The boot / launch / verdict skeleton is shared
 * (tests/xxdp-lib.js); this file declares only KFPAD0's specifics.
 *
 * KFPAD0 vs EKBBF0:
 *   - launched with the exact name "R KFPAD0" (a wildcard like R KFPAD0??
 *     is NOT matched by this monitor — it prints "NOT FOUND: KFPAD0.B").
 *   - the banner / first report takes ~20-30 s to appear (self-paced), so use
 *     a generous wait before asserting it started.
 *   - it loops endless passes, reporting every 4; we assert the FIRST clean
 *     "END PASS #N". The pass counter grows so the regex must not hardcode
 *     "# 1", and the report line is a bare "END PASS #N" (no TOTAL ERRORS
 *     suffix — unlike EKBBF0).
 *
 * Run with:  node tests/e2e-xxdp-kfp.js
 * Exit code 0 = KFPAD0 reached a clean END PASS.
