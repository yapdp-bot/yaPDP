All notable changes to **yaPDP — Yet Another PDP-11/70 web emulator** are
documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-10

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Demo-reel voice-over narration on the title cards.** `tools/assemble-video.js`
  now speaks the intro, every clip's title card and the outro with a generated
  English narration (`tools/voicer.js`, Kokoro-82M or Windows SAPI);
  the WAVs are cached in `video/voice/` (rebuilt with `--voice-regen`, and the
  light reverb / pseudo-stereo added to the dry mono voice can be disabled with
  `--no-voice-reverb`). The intro card waits a beat (~3 s, until its title
  has fully faded in) before the voice starts. A card whose narration is
  longer than its default duration is stretched — freezing the last fully
  visible frame (just before the card's fade-out), so the speech never runs
  on an already-blackened screen — until the narration (plus its reverb tail)
  fits entirely, and the background music is ducked while it plays. The pure
  timing helpers live in `tools/reel-voice-util.js` with unit tests in
  `tests/reel-voice.test.js`.

- **Kokoro-82M neural narration engine for the demo reel.** The voice-over
  recorder (`tools/voicer.js`) can now synthesize the narration locally with
  **Kokoro-82M** through the official `kokoro-js` package (Transformers.js +
  onnxruntime-node on CPU, voice **US Michael** by default) — far less
  synthetic than the Windows SAPI voice, and fully headless: no browser and
  no network voice dependency. The quantized model (~86 MB) is downloaded
  once into the gitignored `.cache/kokoro/` and then reused (a CI checkout
  never re-downloads it); voices ship inside the package. Select it with
  `node tools/voicer.js --engine kokoro ...` or, for the whole reel,
  `node tools/assemble-video.js --voice-engine kokoro --voice-regen`; the
  `auto` engine (Kokoro, falling back to Windows SAPI) remains the default.
  Pure engine-selection/config helpers are pinned in `tests/voicer.test.js`.
  (`package.json`, `tools/voicer.js`, `tools/assemble-video.js`,
  `tests/voicer.test.js`, `.gitignore`)

- **Timed reel events while a demo clip is recorded.** The clip recorder
  (`tools/record-video.js`) now lets the scenario stamp timed events on the
  media timeline as it drives the machine — chapters (YouTube chapter
  markers), banner titles, spoken phrases and bottom subtitles — either
  declaratively on `extra` steps (`{ chapter/speak/title }`) or imperatively
  via a per-shot event recorder (`markChapter()`, `speak()`, `title()`,
  `subtitle()`). The events are written to `video/<base>.events.json`, and
  `tools/assemble-video.js` turns them into narration: every spoken phrase is
  synthesised through `tools/voicer.js` (content-addressed WAV cache) and mixed
  into the clip audio at its media offset, banner titles are burned into the
  finished MP4s, and `video/*.chapters.txt` + `video/*.srt` sidecars are
  written next to each output (`--burn-subtitles` also burns the bottom
  subtitle lines). Pure event/timing helpers live in `tools/reel-timeline-util.js`
  with unit tests in `tests/reel-timeline.test.js`; structural wiring tests in
  `tests/record-events.test.js` and `tests/assemble-events.test.js`.
  (`tools/record-video.js`, `tools/assemble-video.js`,
  `tools/reel-timeline-util.js`, the three new test files)

- **Server-side demo-video builds (GitHub Actions).** The whole demo-reel
  pipeline now runs on demand from the server: the manually-triggered
  **build-promo-videos** workflow (`.github/workflows/videos.yml`) checks out
  the requested branch, records every guest-OS clip on an `ubuntu-latest`
  runner (Chrome from the `puppeteer` postinstall, optional Xvfb-backed headed
  capture for reliable in-tab audio), assembles the reel + per-clip MP4s with
  the local Kokoro-82M narration and uploads them as a downloadable artifact.
  Two cross-platform gaps were closed along the way: the drawtext cards no
  longer hard-code Windows-only fonts — `tools/reel-font-util.js` resolves
  Consolas/Arial Bold on Windows and the repo-committed Courier Prime/Michroma
  faces on Linux/macOS (`YAPDP_FONT`/`YAPDP_FONT_BOLD` override); and
  `tools/record-video.js` now also discovers the common Linux Chromium paths
  and the browser bundled by `puppeteer`.
  (`.github/workflows/videos.yml`, `tools/reel-font-util.js`,
  `tools/assemble-video.js`, `tools/record-video.js`, `tests/reel-font.test.js`,
  `tests/record-browser.test.js`)

- **`bootHeadless` wait-for-silence readiness (`stableMs`).** Besides
  matching a known prompt marker (`waitFor`, whole-line by default, or as a
  substring with `waitForMode: "substring"`), the headless boot machinery
  can now treat the boot as ready once console output stays quiet for
  `stableMs` ms — no marker required. This makes it possible to explore an
  unknown guest image (whose prompts are not known yet) headlessly and then
  derive the readiness markers from the captured boot output.
  (`tools/headless-machine.js`, test 4 in `tests/headless-machine.test.js`)

### Removed

- **Browser loopback capture voice engine.** `tools/voicer.js` no longer
  records Chrome's Web Speech API through an ffmpeg DirectShow loopback device:
  the `browser` engine and its `--device`/`--force-sapi`/`--rate`/`--pitch`/
  `--volume` flags are gone. The narration is produced by the two remaining
  mechanisms — Kokoro-82M (`kokoro`) and Windows SAPI (`sapi`) — with `auto`
  trying Kokoro first and falling back to SAPI.
  (`tools/voicer.js`, `tools/assemble-video.js`, `tests/voicer.test.js`)

### Fixed

- **Server-built demo-reel videos run end to end on CI.** The
  `build-promo-videos` workflow no longer dies at any point of the pipeline:
  it records every guest-OS clip (Chromium launch made root-safe, the
  browser executable path exported asynchronously — `puppeteer.executablePath()`
  is a `Promise` in Puppeteer v25 and previously leaked a raw `Promise { … }`
  literal into `$GITHUB_ENV`, which GitHub Actions rejected) and assembles a
  correct reel and per-clip MP4s with the distro ffmpeg (the static
  `ffmpeg-static` build lacks the `drawtext` filter the caption cards need).
  The Verify step no longer misreports the assembled audio as missing: the
  reel and every clip carry a real audio stream, and the check now matches it.
  (`.github/workflows/videos.yml`, `tools/record-video.js`,
  `tools/assemble-video.js`)
- **`buildSapiScript()` no longer re-resolves the output path.** The pure
  PowerShell-script builder embedded `path.resolve(outPath)` into the emitted
  script. On Linux (the CI runner) `path.resolve` of a Windows-style path such
  as `C:\tmp\voice-out.wav` treated it as relative and prefixed the CWD, so the
  emitted `SetOutputToWaveFile(...)` argument no longer matched the expected
  verbatim path — breaking `tests/voicer.test.js` on the Linux unit job. The
  caller (`sapiSpeak`) already resolves the path before handing it in, so the
  builder now embeds `outPath` verbatim (single-quote escaped only), staying
  pure and platform-independent. (`tools/voicer.js`, `tests/voicer.test.js`)

- **Emulator hangs, image loads and headless-tool correctness fixed.**
  VT11 (`src/vt11.js`) calls the global `requestInterrupt()` function that
  was only defined in the legacy `src/iopage.js`; the refactored machine layer
  (`src/browser-machine.js`) now provides the same global so the VT11 can
  signal interrupts and Lunar Lander proceeds past the GREETINGS screen into
  the landing phase. The image loader also accepts a plain file when no
  compressed `.zst` variant exists (`lander.ptap` ships raw — previously a
  404), the Minimal desktop build ships the bootcode tape it needs again, and
  the Manual page's "Launch the Emulator" button actually launches.
  On the headless/CLI side, `headless-term` keeps the guest's captured output
  when a boot times out (instead of discarding it), `:export` resolves output
  paths from the working directory (not the repo root) and `:status` after a
  `:rewind` reports the tape state truthfully; `bootHeadless` can treat a
  console that has stayed quiet for `stableMs` as booted so an unknown guest
  image can be explored and its readiness prompt captured.

- **Manual screenshots stay in sync with the React landing.**
  `tools/screenshots-manual.js` previously wrote every shot only to
  `assets/images/manual/`, letting the landing mirror
  (`landing/public/assets/images/manual/`) drift out of date. Each generated
  PNG is now written to both tracked locations, and all manual illustrations
  were regenerated from current `master` — they now show the machine's real
  quiet `@` bootstrap prompt instead of the stale `Boot>` banner.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-04

### Architecture: the machine layer becomes cards on a bus

- **Core machine stack (`?core=1` era ended — it is now the default).** The
  PDP‑11/70 machine is no longer welded to the UI. Following the hardware's
  own Unibus idea (1969), the machine layer is split into core base classes
  (`src/core/`: bus, device, machine) and one module per peripheral
  (`src/devices/`): DL11, KW11, RK11, RL11, RP11, TM11, UDA50 (MSCP),
  PTR11/PTP11, LP11, MMU and CPU registers — 1:1 DOM-free ports of the
  legacy iopage closures. `pdp11.html` boots the core stack by default; the
  monolithic `src/iopage.js` remains reachable with `?core=0` as the
  reference/rollback implementation.
- **Headless machine.** The same cards assemble in pure Node
  (`tools/headless-machine.js`) — RT‑11 boots to its prompt in ~1.6 s with
  no browser. `tools/headless-term.js` is the CLI tool of record
  (`:mount`/`:export`/`:wait`/`:raw`, Ctrl+E SIMH-style command mode);
  `tools/rt11-term.js` (puppeteer era) is deprecated.
- **Shared write-back.** DiskStore moved to `src/diskstore.js`; the browser
  core stack persists guest writes through the same IndexedDB overlay as
  legacy.
- **Tooling seam.** Internal `__yapdpBridge` is always exposed; the legacy
  `window.*` bridge surface is gated behind `?bridge=1`.
- **Stack-parity gate.** `tests/e2e-osboot.js` boots **ten guest OSes**
  (Unix V5, RT‑11 ×2, RSX‑11M 3.2/4.6, RSTS V06C/V7.0/E 9.6/10.1, XXDP,
  BSD 2.9/2.11, BASIC‑11) through the wizard on the core stack;
  `E2E_LEGACY=1` runs the same matrix on `?core=0`. RSTS/E 9.6+10.1 boot
  is a regression anchor for the UDA50 fix below.
- **Docs:** `docs/machine-layer.md` (design deep-dive), ARCHITECTURE
  updated for both stacks, `docs/ROADMAP.md` added, known issues linked to
  GitHub issues.

### Fixed

- **UDA50 debug guard.** `process.env.DEBUG_UDA` was read without a
  `typeof process` guard, crashing the browser CPU loop when RSTS/E 9.6 /
  10.1 autoconfigured the UDA50 (they probe every controller, even when
  booting from RP).
- **Paper-tape re-mount after reset.** `boot()`/device reset forgot the PTR
  tape; the DOM-free card cannot lazily rebuild from the Storage select, so
  the adapter re-applies the selected tape after reset/restore — BASIC‑11
  boots on the core stack again (`@BOOT PR` → `*O` in ~2 s).
- **RSTS/RSX quick-boot scenarios.** RSTS `Option:` answers corrected
  (`START` starts timesharing; the historic `^J` is honoured, blind
  `11,70`/`PDP` dropped); RSX‑11M images autostart, so the blind MCR typing
  was removed.


### Added

- **Automatic NUL lead-in / trailer on the ASR paper tape.** A fresh tape
  (tear-off) now starts with 6 blank NUL rows — the historic lead-in: the
  punch feeds the tape while no data pins fire, so the tape gets a
  mechanically-sound blank stretch (a RUB OUT leader would be all holes and
  tear on loading). Disengaging the punch (machine DC4 or the OFF button)
  punches the matching 6-row NUL trailer before the tape stops. The saved
  `.ptap` includes the leader, byte-exact. (`src/punchtape.js`,
  `src/pdp11-app.js`; e2e updated in `tests/e2e-teletype-tape.js`,
  `tests/reader.test.js`.)

- **Guest-OS boot e2e test (`tests/e2e-osboot.js`, `npm run e2e:os`).** Boots
  four real guest operating systems through the quick-boot wizard in Chromium
  — exactly the user path (magic-wand picker -> scenario click) — and asserts
  each reaches its ready state: Unix V5 and BSD 2.11 to the shell prompt
  (auto-login typed by the wizard's prompt-aware logic), RT-11 to its "."
  monitor prompt once the boot output settles, and DEC BASIC-11 to its "*O "
  prompt. Covers the emulator core, the boot sequences and the wizard's
  login-typing end to end; failures save an artifact screenshot and the
  console tail to `tests/artifacts/`. The suite starts its own dev server if
  :1170 is not serving.


- **BASIC-11 from the ASR paper-tape reader (promo clip `basic-tape`).**
  The demo-reel generator now has a second BASIC-11 clip: it boots BASIC-11
  on the Model 33 ASR teletype, then feeds an integer-valued "heart" program
  from the ASR tape reader in AUTO mode (one byte per DL11 drained signal)
  instead of typing it, so the whole program + RUN come off the tape. The
  drawing is pure integer math — this BASIC-11 V007A build has no integer
  variables and TAB() errors, so the program uses real variables holding exact
  small integers, leading-space loops and no FPP built-ins / fractional STEP
  (verified by `tools/_debug-basic-tape.js`; the FPP suspicion from the sine
  demo turned out to be a TAB() error, not FPP). The clip is registered in the
  reel CLIPS (`tools/assemble-video.js`); the capture feeds the reader with the
  raw console queue so the tape never animates the keys, and the quick-boot
  list scroll is now DOWN-only so the first item (BASIC) is not scrolled on
  camera. Structural coverage: `tests/video-shots.test.js`.

- **Labelled title cards in the standalone demo MP4s.** Every exported
  `<name>.mp4` now shows a title card (the same slide the reel uses, e.g.
  "DEC BASIC-11 · ASR TAPE") right after the product intro, so the viewer
  knows what the demo demonstrates before the clip starts — matching the
  reel's per-clip title cards. The card text uses the intro's subtitle style
  (bold sans-serif, light with a dark outline) and is sized up to read
  clearly as the clip's description, and the card is overlaid with the same
  CRT scanlines as the intro. The card is held ~3x longer than the reel's
  quick title cards (9 s), and the intro card's final-frame hold was raised
  to 8 s so the green "DEC era" line stays readable before the fade-out /
  cross-fade.

- **Crisper promo videos (native capture resolution).** The tab capture was
  silently capped at 800×600 by `chrome.tabCapture`'s default and then
  upscaled to the 1280×800 export — hence blurry, smeared clips. The recorder
  now passes explicit `videoConstraints` (1280×800@30) so the raw WebM is
  captured at the full native resolution, the intermediate VP8 bitrate is
  raised (12 Mbps) and the final H.264 export uses CRF 18 instead of 20.
  Re-record with `npm run record:video` to pick up the sharper capture.


- **Build manifest (`media/manifest.json`) + availability-aware quick-boot
  picker.** A deployment now declares which guest images it ships: the
  manifest is generated from `media/` by `node tools/gen-media-manifest.js`
  (deterministic, committed, drift-guarded by `tests/media-manifest.test.js`).
  The magic-wand picker lists only guest OSes whose image is in the manifest
  and/or mounted in DataLoader (desktop bundle, drag & drop imports) — so the
  **Minimal** desktop build no longer advertises OSes it cannot boot; paper
  tapes always stay (tiny, keep the demo bootable). Deployments without a
  manifest (ad-hoc hosts, `file://`) keep the previous show-everything
  behaviour. The Info page's guest-OS table is annotated the same way: rows
  whose image is not shipped are dimmed with an *image not in this build*
  note. Desktop: `tauri-bundled.js` re-renders the picker once the bundle
  finishes mounting. New e2e coverage: `tests/e2e-quickboot-manifest.js`
  (reduced manifest, absent manifest, drag-drop union, Info annotation,
  full-repo manifest).


- **Working ASR paper-tape reader.** The TAPE READER on the Model 33 ASR
  console now actually reads: **Load tape** opens a file dialog for a
  `.ptap`, `.ptap.zst` or `.txt` tape, which hangs from the reader slot down
  to the window edge (same 8-track rows and ragged free end as the punched
  tape). **START** feeds the tape at the console speed; **AUTO** sends one
  byte and then one per DL11 "input drained" signal (paused by DC3/X-OFF,
  resumed by DC1/X-ON); **STOP** and **FREE** show the **Remove tape**
  button (hidden while START or AUTO is running); loading a tape forces
  the reader to **STOP** so a fresh tape never starts feeding on its own.
  The ASR tape unit is cast from the SAME plastic as the teletype cover —
  the keyboard deck's sand gradient with the same subtle grain and inner
  top shadow, no contrasting frame (the punch/reader areas are transparent
  parts of the one body). The grain texture is shared with the printer
  face, the deck and the ASR unit, so the whole console reads as one
  moulded cabinet. The punch and reader contours are raised plastic
  plates (relief): a lighter sand tone than the body with the same grain,
  a top highlight and a drop shadow; both plates are the same width
  (144px) and the TAPE PUNCH / TAPE READER labels centre on them. The
  decorative corner screws were removed.
  The CCU routes every read byte
  exactly like the keyboard: **LOCAL** prints the tape on paper only
  (tape-to-paper copy), **LINE** sends it to the machine and the guest's
  echo prints it (a local print would double every character on echoing
  guests like BASIC); with the punch engaged every read byte is also
  punched onto the output tape — the classic ASR tape-to-tape duplication
  trick. Removing a tape from the reader is silent (no rip sound). The
  punched tape hangs one step above the reader tape (z-index), so it
  always passes in front of the reader mechanism — as on the real ASR-33.
  The tape visibly moves up and shortens as it is read, and the reader
  tape joins the machine-state snapshots (L2) alongside the punched tape.

- **Full machine-state snapshots.** The snapshot feature now captures the
  whole machine, not just the CPU: RAM, MMU and mounted images ([`d292244`](https://github.com/amesk/yaPDP/commit/d292244)); the registers of all nine I/O-page devices — KW11, DL11×3, LP11, PTR11/PTP11 (including the punch buffer), TM11, RK11, RL11, RP11, UDA50 — through clean `snapshot()`/`restore()` hooks that never read registers with hardware side effects ([`f0b866a`](https://github.com/amesk/yaPDP/commit/f0b866a)); the punched paper tape ([`d06f564`](https://github.com/amesk/yaPDP/commit/d06f564)); the LP11 printed paper ([`27a95a1`](https://github.com/amesk/yaPDP/commit/27a95a1)); the LP11 ON LINE state ([`142b2c9`](https://github.com/amesk/yaPDP/commit/142b2c9)); the VT52 terminals with their screen buffers ([`3940ebb`](https://github.com/amesk/yaPDP/commit/3940ebb)); and the VT11 vector display — registers and the CRT image itself ([`21d420f`](https://github.com/amesk/yaPDP/commit/21d420f)).
- **Machine-state dialog.** The STATE floating button opens a snapshot
  manager (save/load/rename/delete) that replaces the old snapshot section
  on the Storage page ([`0c4289b`](https://github.com/amesk/yaPDP/commit/0c4289b)). Restoring a snapshot also restores the hardware device set, with styled confirm modals ([`24d3772`](https://github.com/amesk/yaPDP/commit/24d3772)) and a styled rename dialog instead of the native `window.prompt` ([`8e42159`](https://github.com/amesk/yaPDP/commit/8e42159)).
- **Persistent disk write-back cache (DiskStore).** Guest-OS writes are
  saved to browser storage and overlaid on the base image on the next
  launch, with per-image or full reset on the Storage page ([`49f379b`](https://github.com/amesk/yaPDP/commit/49f379b)).
- **Linux desktop builds**: deb and AppImage bundle targets for the Tauri
  app ([`14c14a7`](https://github.com/amesk/yaPDP/commit/14c14a7)).
- **About block**: version marker in the navigation sidebar and an About
  section on the Info page ([`e091062`](https://github.com/amesk/yaPDP/commit/e091062)).
- **Storage page tabs** (Images / Paper Tapes): the two storage workflows
  are now separated; the Paper Tapes tab gets its own `.ptap` drop zone,
  and the full-window drop target appears only while the Storage page is
  active (previously it showed on every page, where a drop mounted the
  image with no visible feedback) ([`faae411`](https://github.com/amesk/yaPDP/commit/faae411)).
- **Quick boot button** in the welcome dialog and an **Auto-boot shortcut**
  in the power-off dialog ([`d2e8a72`](https://github.com/amesk/yaPDP/commit/d2e8a72)).
- Floating **REBOOT and STATE buttons on the VT52 console page** too
  ([`820def1`](https://github.com/amesk/yaPDP/commit/820def1)).

### Changed

- Repository moved from GitVerse to GitHub — the canonical home is now
  [`github.com/amesk/yaPDP`](https://github.com/amesk/yaPDP). The git remote,
  all landing-page links and the `repository` fields in `package.json` and
  `Cargo.toml` now point at GitHub; every commit/release URL in this changelog
  has been updated accordingly ([`2e13a61`](https://github.com/amesk/yaPDP/commit/2e13a61)).
- Snapshot UI hint updated to reflect the full L2/L3 state capture
  ([`1c3f208`](https://github.com/amesk/yaPDP/commit/1c3f208)).

### Fixed

- **LP11 printer buttons render at full brightness again.** The cabinet's
  drop shadow (`0 26px 44px`) was painting over the button row below it (the
  cabinet is a positioned element, so it draws after the inline content),
  making the buttons ~30% darker than every other operator button. The
  printer action row now sits above the shadow (`.printer-actions` gets
  `position: relative; z-index: 1`).

- ASR punch **BSP** no longer erases the last byte by itself — it pulls the
  tape back one step, so the hanging tail visibly shortens as the row
  disappears into the punch unit, and the next punch overpunches the row now
  under the punch head, holes OR-ing together like a real overpunch. The
  erasure is the **DELETE / RUB OUT** key's job: it punches all holes over
  the byte, turning it into DEL — the authentic two-step ASR-33 correction
  ([`92e10c5`](https://github.com/amesk/yaPDP/commit/92e10c5)).
- ASR receive punch now records machine output too: a **NUL** from the
  machine punches a blank row with only the feed hole — the classic tape
  leader/trailer that threads the reader — and a received **DEL** punches an
  all-holes RUB OUT row, exactly like a real ASR-33 receive punch. The LOCAL
  echo no longer punches a second row for bytes the keyboard punch already
  recorded ([`1671979`](https://github.com/amesk/yaPDP/commit/1671979)).
- **UI chrome re-fonted to VT323** (OFL, bundled woff2): buttons, dialogs,
  sidebar, badges, labels, the CONFIG page, the machine lettering (DEC
  wordmark, bezel letters) and the ASR/LP11 key legends now render in the
  VT320-style terminal face instead of Arial/Helvetica, so the whole
  interface reads like a 1970s DEC terminal. The console output keeps its
  authentic bitmap VT52 glyphs and the LP11 paper keeps lp1_regular; the
  handwritten Help Me! sticker is untouched. Font sizes were re-tuned per
  element (VT323 is a pixel face, illegible below ~11 px).
- **Help Me! sticker re-fonted to Kalam** (OFL, bundled): the operator's
  handwritten note now uses a real handwriting face (Kalam) instead of the
  system cursive stack (Segoe Script/Comic Sans), with sizes bumped for
  legibility; the boot-command listing on the note stays monospaced (VT323)
  so the address columns line up.
- **Chrome font sizes re-tuned for readability**: after the VT323 retrofit
  every label was re-checked on the real screen; sizes were raised across
  the board (sidebar 9→12 px, keycap legends 9–10→11–12 px, switch
  positions 11→13 px, badges/labels 13→15 px, CONFIG labels 12→14 px,
  modal titles 22→24 px, and more). Form controls (buttons, selects,
  inputs) now inherit the chrome font too — the UA stylesheet was silently
  rendering them in Arial.
- **Chrome font switched VT323 → Courier Prime** (OFL, bundled): the
  pixel VT323 was still hard to read at UI sizes (small x-height, thin
  strokes). Courier Prime (typewriter face, real Bold included) keeps the
  rough, hand-made feel of the original while staying legible; a brief
  Share Tech Mono experiment was dropped for lacking that character. The
  console output keeps its bitmap VT52 glyphs, the LP11 paper keeps
  lp1_regular, the sticker keeps Kalam.
- **Teletype machine chrome stays pixel VT323**: the ASR-33's own labels
  (keycaps, punch/reader switch positions, CCU knob, operator buttons)
  were too wide in Courier Prime and shifted the machine layout, so they
  keep the narrow VT323 their geometry was tuned for. Courier Prime
  remains everywhere else (panel, dialogs, sidebar, CONFIG, LP11 badges).
- **LP11 and VT52 machine chrome also back to VT323** (badge, keys,
  bezel lettering, status): same narrow-advance logic as the teletype —
  machines speak the pixel font, the rest of the UI speaks Courier Prime.
- **Front-panel machine chrome back to VT323 too**: Courier Prime's wider
  and taller glyphs overflowed the keycaps (ENABLE/HALT, S INST/S BUS,
  START) and the status label strips (PAR/ADRS ERR/RUN/...). The panel —
  like the teletype, LP11 and VT52 — keeps the narrow pixel VT323.
- **Engraved "digital" wordmark and cabinet caption set in Michroma**
  (OFL, bundled): the real DEC lettering was in the spirit of
  Microgramma/Eurostile, and Michroma is the closest free analogue — the
  wordmark letters on the front panel, the VT52 bezel and the LP11 cover,
  plus the "digital equipment corporation • maynard, massachusetts"
  caption, now use it. Keycaps and status strips keep pixel VT323.
- **Front-panel masthead caption placement fixed for good**: checked
  against a photo of a real PDP-11/70 masthead, the caption belongs *to
  the right* of the boxed "digital" wordmark on the same line, vertically
  centred — which is where the emulator had it all along; the earlier
  "under the wordmark" reading of the photo was wrong. The caption is now
  engraved-small (Michroma at 8px, ~1/3 of the letter height, like the
  original) so the full "digital equipment corporation • maynard,
  massachusetts" fits on one line in the space next to the wordmark.
- **Status LED labels readable again**: the labels next to the LEDs (PAR,
  ADRS ERR, RUN, ..., ADDRESSING 16/18/22, PARITY HIGH/LOW, ADDRESS) were
  set at 7px — fine for Arial, but VT323's thin pixel strokes became
  nearly invisible at that size. Bumped the status blocks and LED base
  plates to 9px (~0.7 of the LED height, matching the real panel) and
  fixed the label strip's line-height so the text sits inside its strip
  instead of bleeding into the LED area.
- **Front-panel lettering back to its original arial** (deployed version
  as the reference): Alexei compared the panel against the live GitHub
  Pages build and the arial lettering there was far more readable than
  VT323's thin pixel strokes at the small sizes the keycaps and status
  strips need. The panel base returns to arial 7px (switch labels, status
  labels, LED base plates) exactly like the deployed build; only the
  engraved Michroma masthead stays. All labels fit their keycaps and
  strips again.
- **LP11 "digital" wordmark lowercase again**: the stamped wordmark on the
  LP11 cover was forced to uppercase by a stray `text-transform: uppercase`
  in `.lp11-dec-letter` — the real DEC wordmark is lowercase, like the
  front-panel masthead. Removed the transform; the seven letters now read
  "digital" (Michroma, engraved look).
- **One face for all operator buttons**: Help Me! / Bootstrap now! (panel
  actions), the teletype controls (Tear tape / Tear paper / Save tape /
  Load tape / Remove tape) and the printer actions (Print / Save .txt /
  Tear paper) now share a single typeface — VT323 14px bold — and the same
  dark-amber gradient, exactly like the already-unified teletype controls.
  Previously the panel actions were Courier Prime 12px and the printer
  actions Courier Prime 14px, so identical-looking buttons rendered in
  three different faces. The CONFIG/STORAGE action buttons (Restore
  defaults, Apply, Unmount, Reset image, Reset all, Rewind tape, Download,
  Clear) were already uniform (Courier Prime 14px bold) and stay as their
  own set.
- **Storage "Persistent disk changes" row no longer merges**: "Reset all"
  used to wrap onto the line below the combobox and sat flush against it,
  looking like part of the select. The field is now a flex row (gap 8px);
  the select is capped at 190px and the buttons at 12px padding so all
  three controls fit on one line — and if the window is ever too narrow,
  the wrap keeps the same clean gap instead of touching the select.
- **CONFIG hint spacing after action buttons**: the "Fills the form with
  factory values…" hint sat 4px under "Restore defaults", looking glued to
  the button. Hints that directly follow an action button now get an 8px
  gap (the "Apply" field benefits too); hints after selects/radios keep
  the tighter 4px spacing.
- **Operator buttons restyled to the manual's "Launch the Emulator"
  recipe**: the PANEL (Help Me! / Bootstrap now!), CONSOLE (Tear tape /
  Tear paper / Save tape / Load tape / Remove tape) and PRINTER (Print /
  Save .txt / Tear paper) buttons looked flat and muddy at VT323 14px with
  faux bold. They now follow the manual page's call-to-action exactly:
  Courier Prime 11px uppercase with 0.5px letter-spacing, the engraved
  inset amber top highlight and a soft drop shadow (same dark-amber
  gradient and border as before).
- **One shared action-button recipe for the whole app**: the operator
  buttons (PANEL / CONSOLE / PRINTER) and the form buttons (CONFIG /
  STORAGE: Restore defaults, Apply, Unmount, Reset image, Reset all,
  Rewind tape, Download, Clear) now all read from a single grouped rule —
  `.panel-action-btn, .tty-btn, .printer-actions button, .config-control
  button` — instead of three duplicated copies in two files. The
  CONFIG/STORAGE buttons were still Courier Prime 14px sentence case and
  flat; they now use the same small uppercase + engraved bevel recipe as
  the operator buttons, so one edit tunes every action button at once.
  (The round punch-key caps keep their VT323 labels; the Apply "dirty"
  highlight and the persist-row sizing overrides still apply.)
- **Manual: the console section is readable again**: the "Paper-tape
  reader" bullet had grown into a 200-word wall covering five topics. It
  is now four separate bullets — reader/load, the four-position reader
  switch (START / AUTO / STOP / FREE as a nested list), the CCU knob
  (LINE / OFF / LOCAL) and tape duplication — so each topic can be
  scanned on its own.
- **Printer buttons are no longer dimmed by the machine's shadow**: the
  LP11 cabinet's drop shadow (`0 26px 44px rgba(0,0,0,0.5)`) landed
  exactly on the Print / Save .txt / Tear paper row, and because the
  cabinet is `position: relative` it painted over the inline buttons —
  they rendered ~30% darker than every other action button. The
  `.printer-actions` row is now lifted above the shadow
  (`position: relative; z-index: 1`), so the buttons read as bright as
  the PANEL / CONSOLE ones while the cabinet keeps its floating look.
- **Manual screenshots regenerated**: all 27 images under
  `assets/images/manual/` were re-captured so they show the current
  look — the shared action-button recipe (small uppercase buttons on
  PANEL / CONSOLE / CONFIG / STORAGE), the brighter printer buttons and
  the current fonts.
- **Mute during continuous LP11 printing** now silences the line-printer
  whirr immediately (and it resumes on unmute). Previously the whirr's stop
  was debounced by 150 ms and re-armed on every print tick, so a mute pressed
  while output kept flowing never took effect — the sound played until the
  print job ended.
- **Restore defaults** on the CONFIG page now really resets the four live
  BEHAVIOUR options — **Reboot confirmation**, **Help Me! sticker**,
  **Machine power** and **Auto-boot** — immediately (they persist the moment
  they change and are read from the config, not the form, so a form-only
  reset never reached them). The machine powers down to the factory "off"
  state; the remaining fields still wait for **Apply**.
- The reboot confirmation dialog ("Reboot the machine?") now carries an
  Auto-boot shortcut: **Start the default bootstrap automatically after
  reboot** — a live mirror of the CONFIG|BEHAVIOUR **Auto-boot** option. The
  tick persists to the config, stays in sync with the CONFIG page checkbox
  and decides whether this reboot runs the built-in default loader or halts
  the machine (the CPU now really stops; a bootstrap already in RAM no
  longer keeps running after a boot-less reboot).
- The CCU knob (LINE/OFF/LOCAL) and the TAPE READER switch (START/STOP/FREE/AUTO)
  now turn by clicking the switch itself, not only the position labels: the
  knob/disc cycles one detent clockwise (LINE → OFF → LOCAL → LINE, START →
  STOP → FREE → AUTO → START) like rotating the real control; labels still
  jump straight to a position.
- The Model 33 keyboard is bit-paired: SHIFT flips bit 4 of the base code,
  CTRL flips bit 6. Held together on a key that carries both legends
  (P @ DLE, K [ VT, N ^ SO, M ] CR) both code bars engage, so
  **CTRL+SHIFT+P** = 0x50^0x10^0x40 = **0x00 = NUL** — the keyboard's only
  way to generate a NULL. With the punch engaged it punches a blank row
  with just the feed hole: the tape leader, punched by hand exactly as
  operators did on the iron. On a PC keyboard **Ctrl+@** does the same
  ([`8a91c2e`](https://github.com/amesk/yaPDP/commit/8a91c2e)).
- CONFIG|Equipment: teletype-only parameters and the LP11 printer width are
  now **disabled and dimmed** (opacity .45) instead of hidden when they do
  not apply to the current selection — the form reads as a stable list where
  greyed-out options explain their dependency, and their values survive the
  switch back ([`ea570ba`](https://github.com/amesk/yaPDP/commit/ea570ba)).
- `trap()`: runaway trap recursion on a corrupted stack (e.g. from an e2e
  test mutating PC/SP/RAM while the CPU is running) now halts the machine
  like real PDP-11 hardware instead of crashing with a `RangeError`
  ([`7d85b61`](https://github.com/amesk/yaPDP/commit/7d85b61)).
- Restoring a snapshot that changes the hardware config no longer triggers
  the browser's "Reload site?" beforeunload prompt ([`6c6d420`](https://github.com/amesk/yaPDP/commit/6c6d420)).
- Quick boot typed boot commands in lower case for the upper-case-only DEC
  guests (BASIC-11, ODT-11, ED-11, RT-11, RSTS, XXDP, RSX-11M) — a real
  ASR-33 teletype cannot produce lower case, and those systems do not
  understand it. The wizard now types `BOOT PR` / `BOOT RK1` etc.; the
  case-sensitive *nix guests (Unix V5, BSD 2.9/2.11, ULTRIX-11) keep their
  lower-case commands ([`1f999ab`](https://github.com/amesk/yaPDP/commit/1f999ab)).

### Documentation

- **Info page**: the "What makes it special" table gains an **Authentic LP11
  Line Printer** row (faithful DEC line printer — cabinet, fanfold paper,
  ON LINE / TOP OF FORM / PAPER FEED — printing at ~300 lines/min, with the
  finished job exportable to a real printer via the system dialog or as a
  `.txt`); table headers on the Info page are now left-aligned. The README
  "What makes it special" table mirrors the new row, and the landing page
  (index.html) mentions the printout export.

- README and user manual: machine-state section, the STATE button in the
  floating-controls table, refreshed screenshots ([`9fdd8bf`](https://github.com/amesk/yaPDP/commit/9fdd8bf)).
- User manual: internal cross-links between sections ([`906c274`](https://github.com/amesk/yaPDP/commit/906c274)).
- User manual: CONFIG screenshots cropped to the page's content column
  ([`43c992d`](https://github.com/amesk/yaPDP/commit/43c992d)).
- User manual and README: Storage section rewritten for the two tabs, with
  new per-tab screenshots ([`faae411`](https://github.com/amesk/yaPDP/commit/faae411)).

### Chore

- **`npm run version:sync` now covers every version location.** It used
  to regenerate only `src/version.js`; the installer versions in
  `src-tauri/tauri.conf.minimal.json` / `tauri.conf.full.json` and the
  `Cargo.toml` crate version had to be bumped by hand and were easy to
  forget. One `package.json` edit + `npm run version:sync` now syncs all
  four (idempotent).
- **Test runner**: `npm test` now delegates to
  [`tools/run-tests.js`](tools/run-tests.js) instead of a 35-entry `&&`
  chain — same canonical order, but the run continues past failures and
  reports every broken file, `npm test -- <substr>` filters by file name and
  `--list` prints the order.
- **Sidebar version marker** now reads `yaPDP v0.1.0`: the marker was
  rendering as `YAPDP` because `.sidebar-version-name` had
  `text-transform: uppercase` in the CSS. The name is displayed as written
  now. (The stylised all-caps `YAPDP` on the promo-video intro title card
  is intentional and unchanged.)
### Chore

- Demo video pipeline: teletype human-input capture, VT52 pacing, MP4
  montage and YouTube-ready exports ([`18549e7`](https://github.com/amesk/yaPDP/commit/18549e7)).
